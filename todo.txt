- 300 word report that highlights 3 technical elements of you inplementation you foind notable: Explain what problem they solve and why you chose to implement them in this way.
include as report.md in repository

HELP:
help - help section for actions


-Well-structured and documented code, including: 
-- Clear and effective variable and function names;
--Use of comments where the code does not speak for itself;
--Clear and effective separation of code into separate functions and possibly files.

- A text file containing a usage guide aimed at peers as the target audience. The usage guide should include plenty of examples.

-The application must support: 

OK Setting and advancing the date that the application perceives as 'today';
OK Recording the buying and selling of products on certain dates;
OK Reporting revenue and profit over specified time periods;
OK Exporting selections of data to CSV files;
--Two other additional non-trivial features of your choice, for example:
OK The use of an external module Rich(opens in a new tab) to improve the application.
--The ability to import/export reports from/to formats other than CSV (in addition to CSV).
--The ability to visualize some statistics using Matplotlib(opens in a new tab) .
Another feature that you thought of.
